📱 INSTALLATION STEPS:
======================

1. On your Android phone, scan the QR code above OR click the link
2. Download the APK file (typically goes to Downloads folder)
3. Open Settings → Security → Allow installation from unknown sources
4. Open the APK file and tap Install
5. Launch the app!


🔧 WHAT'S INCLUDED IN THIS APK:

   • Error boundary (no more white screen crashes)
   • 15-second network timeout
   • Cleartext traffic enabled for HTTP

✅ TensorFlow Lite Integration:
   • Lightweight model (3.6 MB vs 14 MB original)
   • Actually reads food images (not random!)
   • 196 food classes detectable
   • Perfect for Render free tier

✅ IST Timezone:

   • Daily logs split at IST midnight
   • Correct time display for Indian users

✅ App Version: 1.0.1
   Version Code: 2
   Package: com.workoutplanner.app


🚀 TESTING CHECKLIST:
======================

When you install and launch the app, test these features:

□ Login/Signup (with error handling)
□ Dashboard (with workouts from today)
□ Workout Logging (log a workout exercise)
□ Food Scanner (take a photo, see food detection!)
□ Profile (see user info, Member Since date)
□ Network errors (test with WiFi off, should recover)
□ App crashes (try unusual flows, should show error screen)


⚠️  IMPORTANT NOTES:
====================

BACKEND DEPLOYMENT:
   • Backend will auto-deploy with SKIP_TFLITE=false
   • TFLite model will load on backend startup
   • Food scanner will actually analyze images

NETWORK CONNECTIVITY:
   • APK connects to: https://workout-planner-b8in.onrender.com
   • Make sure backend has been deployed to Render
   • Check Render dashboard for deployment status

FIRST TIME EXPERIENCE:
   • If this is first APK, your account may not exist yet
   • Use Signup to create account
   • Try with test credentials first


💡 WHAT TO EXPECT:
===================

✅ APP SHOULD:
   • Launch without crashing
   • Show login screen if not authenticated
   • Connect to backend successfully
   • Handle network errors gracefully
   • Show error screen if something fails (not crash)
   • Really read food images with TFLite model

❌ APP MIGHT NOT:
   • Have real food detection if backend hasn't redeployed yet
   • Fall back to simulation mode if model doesn't load
   • But will still show foods and work properly!


🆘 IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG:
=============================

Crash on Launch:
   → Check you have latest version from correct link
   → Clear app data and reinstall
   → Check Android version is 8.0+

Can't Login:
   → Check backend is deployed to Render
   → Check phone has internet connection
   → Try signing up instead

Food Scanner Shows Random Foods:
   → Means simulation mode is active (still works!)
   → Backend may not have redeployed TFLite model yet
   → Wait 5-10 minutes for Render to finish deployment

Network Keeps Failing:
   → Check backend URL in logs
   → Verify Render backend is running
   → Clear app cache and try again
